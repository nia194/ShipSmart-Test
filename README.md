Cross-repo **contract** + live **e2e** integration tests for the ShipSmart
platform — the single place that proves the five services agree on their wire
shapes and actually work together end to end.

**Stack:** Python 3.13 · uv · pytest (+ pytest-asyncio) · httpx · PyJWT · ruff

## The ShipSmart ecosystem

This repo is the cross-repo **test harness** for the five ShipSmart services.
Clone them all under one parent directory so the contract suite can resolve each
sibling by relative path (see `sibling.py`):

```
<any parent directory>/
├── ShipSmart-Web/   ShipSmart-API/   ShipSmart-MCP/
├── ShipSmart-Orchestrator/   ShipSmart-Infra/
└── ShipSmart-Test/   ← you are here
```

All six are also mirrored together in
**[ShipSmart](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart)** — the umbrella
repository that snapshots each component at its latest stable milestone.

| Repo | Role | What this suite checks |
|------|------|------------------------|
| [ShipSmart-Web](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart-Web) | React SPA — user-facing UI | TS types ↔ API / Java / MCP wire shapes |
| [ShipSmart-Orchestrator](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart-Orchestrator) | Java transactional API — single Postgres writer | `ShipmentSummaryDto` ↔ Web; live `/shipments` JWT-scoping + ownership |
| [ShipSmart-API](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart-API) | Python AI/orchestration — RAG, advisors, recommendations, compliance (UC2), multi-agent workflow (UC3/UC4), conversational concierge | schemas ↔ Web; live advisor / RAG / compliance / workflow / concierge |
| [ShipSmart-MCP](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart-MCP) | MCP tool server | tool `input_schema` ↔ API test double ↔ Web context; live API→MCP hop |
| [ShipSmart-Infra](https://github.com/nia194/ShipSmart-Infra) | Supabase migrations + env + docs | `match_rag_chunks_lexical` SQL signature ↔ API |

## What this repo verifies

Two complementary layers — one static, one live:

- **Contract** (`contract/`, **no services required**) — parses the sibling
  repos' *source as text* (`sibling.py`) and asserts the wire shapes line up, so
  a field rename in one repo can't silently break a consumer in another. Fast and
  hermetic; runs anywhere (**25 tests**):
  - ShipSmart-API advisor response models ↔ ShipSmart-Web TS types (incl.
    `decision_path` / `source` tags),
  - ShipSmart-API compliance + workflow schemas (`WorkflowResponse`,
    `ComplianceSummary`, the HS/duty/carrier/doc domain models, the
    `cleared|blocked` determination literal) ↔ ShipSmart-Web `workflow-api.ts`,
  - ShipSmart-API concierge schemas + slot superset ↔ ShipSmart-Web
    `concierge-api.ts` / `shipmentDraft.ts` (the shared form ⇄ chat draft),
  - ShipSmart-Orchestrator `ShipmentSummaryDto` ↔ ShipSmart-Web `ShipmentSummary`,
  - ShipSmart-MCP tool `input_schema` ↔ the API's test double ↔ Web context keys,
  - ShipSmart-Web `compare.types.ts` ↔ ShipSmart-API `compare.py`,
  - ShipSmart-Infra `match_rag_chunks_lexical` signature ↔ the API's SQL.
- **e2e** (`e2e/`, **live stack**) — HTTP tests against a running self-contained
  stack: MCP tools, API `/ready` chain report, the **API → MCP** tool hop, RAG
  grounding, guardrail injection block, the **compliance check**, the **concierge chat**
  (greeting orientation, clarify → don't-re-ask → full-state echo, lowercase city routes
  resolving to a full route, and a natural gather-then-complete quote flow), the
  **workflow lifecycle** (process → durable `GET` → human review → resume, plus
  `404`/`409` edges), the **shipping-scope / compliance-explicit policy**
  (`/api/v1/info` publishes the active mode; cross-border shipments are rejected
  iff the deployment is `domestic`-only), and (optional) Java `/shipments`
  JWT-scoping + ownership. Each suite **skips** (never fails) when its service is down.

---

## Layout

- `contract/` — static cross-repo shape checks (no services).
- `e2e/` — live cross-service HTTP tests (`pytest.mark.e2e`).
- `sibling.py` — text-parsing helpers (`ts_interface_fields`, `py_model_fields`,
  `py_class_fields`, `java_record_components`, `json_schema_required`).
- `scripts/run-stack.sh` — host the self-contained stack (pgvector + MCP + API +
  Java; sets `WORKFLOW_ENABLED=true` so the workflow e2e exercises UC3/UC4).
- `docker-compose.yml` — just the pgvector database.
- `postman/` — cross-service Postman collection
  (`collections/cross-service.postman_collection.json` +
  `environments/local.postman_environment.json`): stack health across all three
  services, the shipping-scope policy probe, the concierge → multi-agent workflow
  bridge, and `X-Request-Id` correlation propagation — with assertions on every
  request.

## Running the suites

```bash
uv run ruff check .              # lint
uv run pytest contract/         # fast; nothing to host (25 tests)
scripts/run-stack.sh up         # host the stack (Docker required)
uv run pytest e2e/              # live cross-service tests (32 tests)
newman run postman/collections/cross-service.postman_collection.json \
  -e postman/environments/local.postman_environment.json   # Postman walk of the live stack
scripts/run-stack.sh down       # tear everything down
```

`uv run pytest` alone runs both suites; e2e tests **skip** (never fail) when a
service is down, so `contract/` always passes even with nothing hosted.

**Lint & CI.** `uv run ruff check .` lints the suite, and a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` wires
ruff plus hygiene hooks (end-of-file fixer, trailing whitespace, YAML, merge-conflict). CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff and the **contract** suite on every push / PR; the
e2e suite needs the live stack, so it stays a local/manual step.

---

## The self-contained stack — no real Supabase / LLM keys

- **MCP** uses its mock provider.
- **API** uses the in-memory vector store + `EchoClient`, is pointed at the local
  MCP for tool calls, and runs with `WORKFLOW_ENABLED=true` (compliance is on by
  default) so the UC2/UC3/UC4 e2e paths are exercised.
- **Java** uses Hibernate `create-drop` (Flyway pointed at an empty location so
  the `FlywayValidationRunner` bean still wires but runs no migrations), the
  tracing exporter disabled, and a **test** HS256 JWT secret; e2e tokens are
  minted in `e2e/conftest.py`. The full context boots (the `QuoteCache`
  two-constructor wiring is fixed in ShipSmart-Orchestrator), so the Java e2e
  tests **run** — create → read → list → cross-user ownership (404) against real
  Postgres. They still skip gracefully if Java is intentionally left down.

Override endpoints/secret via `SHIPSMART_E2E_{MCP,API,JAVA}_URL` and
`SHIPSMART_E2E_JWT_SECRET`.

## Hybrid Form ⇄ Chat Sync coverage

Cross-repo coverage for the hybrid form ⇄ chat sync — the shared `ShipmentDraft` store in
ShipSmart-Web and the concierge consuming form-provided slots in ShipSmart-API:

- **Contract** (`contract/test_contracts.py`) — asserts the Web `ShipmentDraft` →
  concierge-state adapters line up with the API's `ConversationState.slots` (the shared
  shipment-context superset both surfaces populate), and that `ConciergeState` /
  `ConciergeResponse` match field-for-field across the two repos.
- **e2e** (`e2e/test_concierge_e2e.py`) — a live-stack flow proving the round trip: a thin
  message clarifies for a missing slot; a request carrying form-provided slots **does not
  re-ask** and dispatches; and the full merged state is echoed back without clobbering.
  It also locks the conversational behaviors at the integration level: a pure greeting is
  oriented instead of dumped to the RAG agent, a lowercase "atlanta to seattle" resolves
  to a route + countries, and a natural "send a gift" conversation gathers details and
  completes instead of dead-ending.
  Skips gracefully when the API is down, like the other e2e suites.

Backed by the Conversational Concierge chat endpoint (`/api/v1/concierge/chat`) in
ShipSmart-API. **No Orchestrator / MCP / Infra change** is involved — the draft is
client-owned. (`scripts/run-stack.sh` sets `CONCIERGE_ENABLED=true` for the e2e run.)
